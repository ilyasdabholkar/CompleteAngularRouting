## 1. Setting up and loading routes

To set up and load routes in your Angular application, follow the instructions in the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 2. Navigation with routerLink

Learn how to navigate using the `routerLink` directive by referring to the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 3. Navigation Paths

Understand how to define navigation paths for your routes by visiting the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 4. Styling active router links

Customize the styling of active router links using the techniques explained in the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 5. Programmatic navigation

Explore programmatic navigation in Angular with the information provided [here](link-to-documentation).

## 6. Relative navigation

Learn about relative navigation in Angular through the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 7. Passing/fetching route params

Discover how to pass and fetch route parameters by referring to the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 8. Route Observables

Understand how to use route observables for more advanced routing scenarios. Documentation can be found [here](link-to-documentation).

## 9. Passing/fetching route query and fragments

Explore the handling of route query parameters and fragments by checking the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 10. Setting up child nested routes

Set up child nested routes for a more organized routing structure. Detailed instructions can be found [here](link-to-documentation).

## 11. Redirection and wildcard routes

Learn about route redirection and wildcard routes by consulting the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 12. Guards: canActivate, canDeactivate

Implement route guards such as `canActivate` and `canDeactivate` using the guidance available [here](link-to-documentation).

## 13. Route Resolvers

Use route resolvers to fetch data before the route is activated. Check out the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

## 14. Passing static and dynamic data to routes

Discover how to pass both static and dynamic data to routes by following the documentation [here](link-to-documentation).

Feel free to explore each topic in the order that suits your learning style. Happy coding!
